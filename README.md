## What is the problem we are solving ?

1. Saturation of current E-Commerce platforms with 0.02% of the artiste industry has caused the 7 million people who identify themselves as local artisans, extremely hard to be found and recognised for their work. 
2. The products on these platforms are very repetitive, lack creativity and customization. The recommendation algorithms cater to the massively popular and well recognised and there is a huge sector of the artist industry who come under the umbrella of "wasted talent". 
3. The hassle of finding personalised and unique articles causes sales decline/downturn which reduces the economic GDP.
4. Tourists often find it hard to explore local art and understand the deep rooted heritage of the place they visit ; thus there is a disconnect in paying homage to the cityâ€™s heritage and finding niche cultural souvenirs. 
5. Studies have even shown that cultural tourists spend more than other tourist types and often stay longer in the communities they visit making it a valuable asset to the regional arts in particular.
